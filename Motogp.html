It is a global sport which features a range of circuits each with its unique challenges, from tight and technical circuits to fast and flowing ones including the iconic Circuit de Barcelona-Catalunya to the fast straights of Mugello in Italy. Renowned manfacturers including Ducati, Yamaha, Suzuki, Honda, Aprilia and various other teams compete for the World Championship. The races are not only a test of speed but also of skill, bravery, and adaptability, as riders navigate hairpin turns, long straights, and unpredictable weather conditions with its history dating back to 1949. </p>

<h3>How it Works</h3>

<br>
<br>

<p>The MotoGP World Championship consists of 21 Grand Prix. Each race lasts between 40 and 45 minutes over a distance of between 100 and 130 km, depending on the circuit. Points are awarded at the finish line for the first 15 riders according to the following scale: 25, 20, 15, 13, 11, 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1 point. This year, a sprint race has been added to Saturday afternoon. It takes place over half the distance of the Sunday Grand Prix and only the first nine finishers score points for the world championship ranking. The scale is as follows: 12 points for the first, 9 for the second, 7 for the third... And so on until the ninth.</p>
